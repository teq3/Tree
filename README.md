Hacking Ready For Sky (R4S) home appliances

This repository holds some data for controlling Redmond SkyKettle RK-M171S from GNU/Linux

I welcome suggestions and ideas for simplification and making code more reliable.
Using script wrapper around gatttool is so far the simplest approach. But it is terribly ugly.

Prerequisits:
   You need bluez installed. Version 4.01 is fine

Usage: 
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] auth 
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] query
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] queryone
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] keeptemp <temp>
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] on
*   ./connect.sh [KETTLE MAC] off

You can get your  [KETTLE MAC] by entering "bt-device -l" 

## Dumps 

You don't need to dump anything, you can just reverse the application itself. Later data had been acquired with decompile method

* dump/auth.on.off.bin 
    Initiate an auth from application. Hold "+" on kettle. Switch kettle "ON". Press "OFF" just a second before 100C
* dump/auth.bin  
    Initiate an auth from application. do nothing on kettle
    


## Hardware

* Bluetooth dongle (CSR4.0) - http://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Bluetooth-4-0-Dongles-Mini-USB-2-0-3-0-Bluetooth-Dongle-Adapters-Dual-Mode-adapter/32292553074.html

## Protocol 

  Protocol had been reversed with the following techique. Dumps were made with "Enable Bluetoog HCI snoop log" Android feature. Analised then with wireshark

### Protocol summary

To start talking to device, you need to connect and write 0x0100 to handle 0x000c (is not listed by the device?).
This needs to be done after every reconnect.
Gatttool doesn't allow you to know when reconnect happend. So I send it every time.

Now you can send commands to handle 0x000e
You will get back the answers from handle 0x000b

#### Command structure

Commands start with 0x55 byte, and end with 0xaa
Second byte is a counter, you should increment it with any new request. I don't know yet what happens when you overflow
Third byte is a command itself
 * 0x01 - happens sometimes, unknown
 * 0x05 - switch the kettle on to keepwarm (on with 0 temperature)
 * 0x04 - switch the kettle off
 * 0x06 - request status
 * 0xFF - authorize
 
 
Next go the parameters.

```
  0x55 0x76 0x06  0xaa
   |    |     |   |
start   |     |  end
    counter   |
        command id
```

As a reply you will recive a sequence that start with 0x55 byte, and end with 0xAA
Second byte is a counter which is the same as in the request it replies to.
Third byte is the command - same as in the request. It depends on the command.
Next goes the data.

#### AUTH
 I can guess you should do the following. Generate a 8byte random ID. This will be your key. 
 I don't know yet if any key is ok. These are - 55:3a:57:47:f8:c2:62:4a, b5:4c:75:b1:b4:0c:88:ef
 
 Send auth command, starting with counter 0

```
 -> 55:<counter>:ff:<8 bytes. Seem random. ID? MAC?>:aa
```

If you are not yet authorized (you need to hold "+" on the kettle for this) the kettle will reply

```
 <- 55:<counter>:ff:00:aa  
```
Send the request again with incrementing counter. Meanwhile hold "+" key. At some point the auth will be passed. And you will get:
   
```
 <- 55:<counter>:ff:01:aa  
```
    
Next time with the same key you should be able to connect from the first attempt.
In the auth state you can issue next commands.

#### Unknown command usually at start

```
   ->  55:<counter>:01:aa
reply example
   <-  55:<counter>:01:02:06:aa
```

#### BOLING AND HEATING command
```
request examples
   ->  55:<counter>:05:00:00:28:00:aa
   ->  55:<counter>:05:00:00:00:00:aa - just switch on.
   ->  55:<counter>:05:01:00:5f:00:aa - keepwarm at 95
   
       55:<counter>:05:00:00:<keep warm temp>:00:aa
   
reply example   
   <-  55:<counter>:05:01:aa    // 01 status meens OK
```

#### OFF command
```
   ->  55:<counter>:04:aa
reply example   
   <-  55:<counter>:04:01:aa       // 01 status meens OK
```

#### STATUS command
```
   -> 55:<counter>:06:aa 
reply examples:
   <- 55:<counter>:06:00:00:00:00:00:0c:00:00:00:00:51:00:00:00:00:00:aa  - kettle is on in boiling 

   <- 55:<counter>:06:00:00:28:00:00:0c:00:01:02:00:33:00:00:00:00:00:aa  - kettle is on
   <- 55:<counter>:06:00:00:00:00:00:0c:00:00:00:00:3e:00:00:00:00:00:aa  - kettle is off
   <- 55:<counter>:06 00 00 28 00 00 0c 00 01 00 00 64 00 00 00 00 00 aa
   
   <- 55:<counter>:06 01 00 28 00 00 0c 00 01 02 00 64 00 00 00 00 00 aa  - kettle finished boiling ()
   <- 55:<counter>:06 01 00 28 00 00 0c 00 01 02 00 63 00 00 00 00 00 aa  - a while after finished boiling
